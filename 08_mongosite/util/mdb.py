Nobel Prize Database
Each document looks similar to this:
{
"year": <STRING>,
"category": <STRING>,
"laureates": [
             {
             "id": <STRING>,
             "firstname": <STRING>,
             "surname": <STRING>,
             "motivation": <STRING>,
             "share": <STRING>,
             },
             ...
             ]
}

as an argument.
